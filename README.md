# Project Nomad

A minimalistic roguelike with simple gameplay and a metroidvania-style level design. A submission for the [Godot Wild Jam #29](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-29).

The game concept is pretty simple: a **metroidvania roguelike**. The player will take control of a nomad navigating through a labyrinth for some undetermined reason. The layout of the level will consist of several randomely selected room presets on a [potentially variably-sized] grid. The player will have simple platforming and combat abilities similar to *Hollow Knight* which must be utilized in order to escape the labyrinth (or meet some other lore-related goal).
